The greater the depth of penetration, the more effective the treatment will be. That said, at-home derma rollers can serve their own purposes. For example, many people use at-home derma rollers nightly or several times a week before applying active skin ingredients like Retinol, since even small micro-channels in the skin will aid in product absorption.
