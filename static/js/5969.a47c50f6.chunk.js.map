The best laser for dark-skinned clients is the Nd: YAG.This is because the Nd: YAG hair removal laser has a different wavelength. \n                     It leaves the skin undamaged and is more precise in its penetration of hair follicles. \n                     Our lasers allow us to treat all skin types without any issues.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    title: \"WHAT ARE THE BEST SKIN TONES TO USE FOR LASER HAIR REMOVAL?\",\n    content: `We use medical-grade lasers to treat all skin tones. There are two different laser machines that we can use to achieve safe results for different skin tones. Here at CoLaz clinic, we start each treatment consultation using the Fitzpatrick Classification Scale to identify your skin tone and recommend the appropriate range of machines.\n                      The Fitzpatrick Scale divides skin tones into six categories ranging from lightest (type 1) to darkest (type 6). This is how our technicians can select which machine will give you the best results.\n                      Our Alex laser is suitable for people who have fair skin. The Yag laser is ideal for people with darker skin.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    title: \"HOW DOES LASER HAIR REMOVAL WORK?\",\n    content: `The laser works by targeting the dark pigment in the hair follicle. \n                      This process is called selective photothermolysis and can be used for any skin tone but offers more excellent success rates on medium to darker tones.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 4,\n    title: \"HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SEE RESULTS?\",\n    content: `The hair growth cycles are different with men, and this is why you will need more than one treatment to remove the hair.\n                      We can discuss your desired hair removal goals during a free consultation and create a suitable treatment plan.\n                      For long-term results, we usually recommend 8-12 treatments 4-6 weeks apart.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    title: \"IS LASER HAIR REMOVAL SAFE FOR PRIVATE PARTS?\",\n    content: `Yes, laser hair removal is safe for men's private parts.
