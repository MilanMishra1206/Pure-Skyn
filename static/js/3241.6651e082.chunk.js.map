Here at CoLaz clinic, we start each treatment consultation using the Fitzpatrick Classification Scale to identify your skin tone and recommend the appropriate range of machines.\n                      The Fitzpatrick Scale divides skin tones into six categories ranging from lightest (type 1) to darkest (type 6). This is how our technicians can select which machine will give you the best results.\n                      Our Alex laser is suitable for people who have fair skin.
