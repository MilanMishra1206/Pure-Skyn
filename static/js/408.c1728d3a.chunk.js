It\u2019s common for patients to require three to six initial appointments to see optimal results. The number of initial appointments you will need may depend on factors such as your age, your skin type and tone, and the conditions you are trying to treat. For example, treating scars will require more treatments than treating dry skin."},{id:2,title:"How Frequently Should You Have Treatments?",content:"During your initial treatments, your appointments will be spaced two to four weeks apart. Your treatment frequency may depend on your skin type, particularly the sensitivity of your skin. For those who are using this treatment to rebuild collagen, it\u2019s sometimes best to allow for more collagen maturation between treatments, which is why your frequency may be every month for your first appointments. After your optimal results have been achieved, you will need to keep up with maintenance appointments to keep collagen production high. Most of the time, your maintenance appointments will be two to three months apart, depending on your skin needs and how long your results last. We will advise you on the best treatment frequency for your skin goals."},{id:3,title:"Is There a Best Time for Treatments?",content:"No, you can have this treatment at any time of the year and at any age. Microneedling is a universal treatment that does not require any preparation or significant aftercare. However, if you are preparing your appearance for a special life event, then you may want to schedule your first treatments at least six months before your event so your skin will be in the best possible condition."},{id:4,title:"How Soon Will You See Results?",content:"It will take several days or sometimes weeks to see the results of your treatment. For superficial concerns, like dry skin, fine lines, minor scarring, and some pigmented lesions, it\u2019s possible you will see the results of your treatment one to two weeks after your first appointment. However, for the treatment of more complex skin concerns, such as wrinkles, deep acne scarring, and stretch marks, it will likely take more than four weeks to see your ideal results. Ultimately, how soon you will see results will depend on the severity of your skin concerns, as well as how well your skin responds to this treatment."},{id:5,title:"How Long Will Results Last?",content:"Much of the time, the majority of the results accomplished with this treatment can be considered permanent. For example, the treatment of deep acne scars and pigmentation concerns like dark spots often produce long-lasting results since cellular turnover and collagen restoration is complete with this system. However, for troubles like fine lines and wrinkles, the results of this treatment will only be temporary. This is because the effects of time on the skin can only be postponed for so long. Because the results of this treatment can be semi-permanent, it\u2019s very important that you attend all of your regularly scheduled appointments so you can enjoy your results for the long term. Even if your results are lasting longer than expected, your maintenance appointments will ensure that these results continue to last."},{id:6,title:"Can You Enhance Results?",content:"Yes, you can enhance the results of your treatment when you use the right skin care after your treatment is complete. The skincare products you use after your treatment will be your best tool to ensure your results last for as long as possible. For age-related concerns, the use of anti-aging products can fortify your collagen production. If you are managing acne breakouts, then it\u2019s important you are using the correct acne-fighting products to minimize breakouts."},{id:7,title:"Can You Combine This Treatment?",content:"Yes, this treatment is very easily combined with other aesthetic treatments. For example, many patients combine microneedling treatments with aesthetic treatments like HydraFacial and microdermabrasion. If you want to combine this treatment with other aesthetic services, please let us know so we can help you build your ideal treatment plan."},{id:8,title:"What Are the Benefits of DermaFrac Microneedling?",content:"Microneedling is one of the current golden standards of aesthetic treatments because it is so universal. However, there are other important benefits for this treatment. For example, this is a non-surgical treatment, which makes it a good choice for patients who are not qualified for surgery or who do not want to undergo plastic procedures."}],r=[...s,{id:9,title:"Is DermaFrac Better Than Traditional Microneedling?",content:"It's hard to say whether one microneedling technique is better than another. While DermaFrac uses a unique rolling system to glide over skin to create precisely-spaced microchannels, traditional microneedling sometimes has a higher level of precision because of how closely the microneedles are clustered. In general, traditional microneedling also has slightly more depth for the needles \u2013 although to be sure, both of these techniques offer better penetration than at-home derma rollers. That said, the microneedling technique that is best for your skin will depend on your skin\u2019s needs. For the treatment of acne scarring and other shallow scarring, traditional microneedling may be effective, particularly for boxcar scars and rolling scars. All other skin concerns can be treated effectively with DermaFrac microneedling system and when combined with PRP."},{id:10,title:"Are At-Home Derma Rollers Just As Effective?",content:"To put it simply, no, any at-home derma roller won't be as effective as a professional aesthetic service. For one thing, at-home derma rollers typically have a very shallow penetration that makes it difficult to treat issues like scarring and fine lines or wrinkles; this is because microneedles with depths over 1 mm must be used by professionals. The greater the depth of penetration, the more effective the treatment will be. That said, at-home derma rollers can serve their own purposes. For example, many people use at-home derma rollers nightly or several times a week before applying active skin ingredients like Retinol, since even small micro-channels in the skin will aid in product absorption. However, please discuss the use of an at-home derma roller alongside professional microneedling treatments during your consultation. Our skin experts will give you the advice that is best for your skin type and needs."},{id:11,title:"Are You a Good Candidate?",content:"If you are dealing with superficial skin concerns like wrinkles, acne scarring, and dark spots, then you are likely a good candidate for this treatment. Whether you are using this system alone or combining this treatment with PRP, you can count on reliable skin-perfecting results."},{id:12,title:"How Does It Work?",content:"The precision controlled Dermafrac hand piece uses vacuum to pull the skin into contact with hundreds of microneedles. The microneedles create pathways for the infusion of targeted serums by penetrating the epidermis above capillaries and nerve endings, ensuring no bleeding and pain. Designed to improve overall appearance of your skin, the procedure results in optimal absorption of serum and stimulates a natural positive response by the body which may increase collagen and fibroblast activity"},{id:13,title:"Is Their Any Downtime?",content:"No. Dermafrac allows you to return to your normal activities immediately after procedure. There will be mild redness which resolves within few hours. If you desire you may reapply make up immediately after the procedure. This effectively leaves your skin with a glowing complexion and instant results; you can apply mineral makeup immediately, and then sit back and feel and see your skin improve daily."},{id:14,title:"Will it Hurt?",content:"Dermafrac feels wonderful.

Deeper scars are better treated with fractional lasers."},{id:18,title:"Does Dermafrac Works on Wrinkles?",content:"Superficial fine lines and wrinkles may be reduced using DermaFrac\u2122. Deep wrinkles or dynamic lines may be softened somewhat, but cannot be completely resolved and are typically better treated with fillers, neuromodulators or laser skin resurfacing."}],l=[{id:1,title:"How Many Treatments Will You Need?",content:"Because microneedling treatments are non-surgical and largely non-invasive, they typically require multiple treatment sessions to make a significant impact.
