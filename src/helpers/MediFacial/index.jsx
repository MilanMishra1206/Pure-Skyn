      "OxyGeneo combines the benefits of microdermabrasion, facials, and skin infusions into one simple, non-invasive therapy. It is paired with two unique formulas to infuse the skin with essential nutrients that improve its texture and appearance. The NeoBright formula is intended to lighten and brighten the skin with azelaic acid, kojic acid, and retinol. The NeoRevive formula is an anti-aging treatment containing hyaluronic acid (the active ingredient found in many fillers), peptides, and retinol.",

    title: "How it works",
    content:
      "OxyGeneo uses a Capsugen® tablet that glides over the surface of the skin to gently exfoliate the upper skin layer, infuse the skin with one of two special formulas to brighten or rejuvenate the skin, and produce CO2 bubbles to gently burst on the surface of the skin. This allows the active ingredients in the NeoBright and NeoRevive formulas to be better absorbed as well as prompt a natural healing response beneath the skin that delivers more oxygen-rich blood to the area. That means more nutrients where you need them most for a continued improvement in your skin.",

    title: "What to expect",

      "Before beginning treatment, we will examine the area under and around the chin to determine if KYBELLA® is right for you. Then we will tailor a treatment designed for your aesthetic goals. The treatment consists of multiple small injections under your chin and is complete in 15-20 minutes. You will likely experience some swelling, bruising, or numbness under your chin. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if you develop an uneven smile, facial muscle weakness, or difficulty swallowing.",

    title: "Why we love it",
    content:
      "We are raving about OxyGeneo because it works for any skin type without any irritation or side effects. It’s the perfect lunchtime treatment that takes just as long as a facial with much more dramatic results. Because there are no noticeable side effects from treatment, it’s also the perfect way to get a last-minute touch up before a major event, where treatments like microdermabrasion and chemical peels would need more healing time.",
